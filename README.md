# Introduction 
The main purpose of this project is to create an open system for the management of a domestic heating system. 

The system is open and provides an example through which it is possible to adapt it for each heating system. The system includes a puffer, solar panel and a boiler.

The management is carried out by an Arduino like system that allows you to detect temperatures and force the start-ups of the pumps remotely, via app, webserver or integration with alexa.
In addition to temperature differences and heat losses the system also considers environmental conditions and weather previsions.
